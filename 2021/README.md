## How to use this repository?

To keep this repository clean, we propose the following structure:

- Each member has its own folder named as his Github account,
- In this folder, he can create one folder per day.

For example, a Typescript project for AoC for the member _awesome-member_, will have the following structure:

<pre>
awesome-member/
├── package.json
├── node_modules/
└── src/
    ├ 01
    ├ 02
    └ …
</pre>
